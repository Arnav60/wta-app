              <p className="text-xl text-gray-800 py-1">Recently I was assigned to the task of adding a Copyright text block to all the JavaScript Source Code files. Initially the task was assumed to be an easy one as I thought of using any related VSCode Extensions to achieve it. However it was proved to be hectic when I found, I have to do it for 250 odd files ðŸ˜²!
              What next? Of course the natural instinct was to, search on web for a tool that does it. I just did that. I found many responses, specially few great directions from StackOverFlow.</p>

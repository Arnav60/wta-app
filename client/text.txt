I have finished the Offer Details Page. Please find the screen in the attachment. The build will be availble to the QA Team


have delivered all my story points before the time. I also made sure to write test cases. I tried not to have bugs related to the stories. For nondependent stories, I made sure to cover all the bugs raised by the QA teams.


When we started the project development process for the mobile frontend, I took it up and created dummy APIs to make minimum dependency on the backend.
With the help of meetings with the product owners, I got to know about the business logic. Due to this, the development process smooth.
In the recent sprints, I got the opportunity to work on QR code scanner functionality. I build a system where we can scan the qr code use it.
As android developer we as a team made sure to keep the code systemtic and cover all the use cases to minimize bugs.

In offers team, we have got pages that will be playing a crucial role in displaying information to the end user 

Adapting to newer concepts is the most challenging but at the same time exciting way to self-learn. Android architects helped in the process to get used to the 
standardized way to code in the project. I adapted the eco-system of project where all the modules are inidependent to each other but at the same time loosely couped with each other.
This helped me to scale up the application module at the same time get me opportunity to work with my other fellow members.

As a full stack develper I contributed on both the platforms i.e frontend (Android) or backend. I took up all the given task and tried to finish it in the given period of time.

My communication with my teams members, product owners, crum master have been very lucid. I as a person beleives in more of a lisnetening than talking.
Whenever I felt I have the points to be discussed. 
I tried to convey it to all the members. The changes in the API are frequent, whenever there was a change in the API, I tried to convey it to my other fellow team members (iOS and PWA).

Collaboration:
I made sure to collaborate with the app team(other team) at the same time with the offers team. It helped me to keep things simple at the same time synced.
Agility:
n the Agile process, I got to learn about how to make the development process smooth. Working on Story points, making significant improvement, helped to get to know more about the business logic.
Learnability / Willingness To Coach Others:
Apart from Android, I have been learning other platforms. For the initial sprints, I got the opportunity to work on the backend. I had created mock APIs as well as built a dashboard using react to generate QR codes for testing the QR Code Stories.
Problem Solving:

Living The TATA Values:
Considering current scenario,


 


I have jotted down the points to be added to the Performance Appraisal System. Please let me know when it will be fixed.
The goals that I still pending to be approved are listed below: 

Process improvements and adherence to guidelines - Driving the issue/delivery to closure as per committed effort and schedule. 100%, <2% issues should come back once reassigned
Process improvements and adherence to guidelines - Effective and accurate status and work activity reporting (including documentation) as per need time to time 100%

Let me know when it's fixed.

During all the development processes, I made sure to be clear and transparent with my teammate. It's more like a family environment where I get to learn from others as well as I also come up with my set of ideas to solutions problems.

Hi Lohit,

I had been facing issue while singing in to the sandbox of resultex. 
I would like to have a meeting on "Resultex Sandbox Pannel" for the QR code generation. We would like to use it to generate QR code for all the stories as well as the edge cases.
Please let me know your availbility on the same.
